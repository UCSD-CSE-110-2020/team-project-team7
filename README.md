# Major Functionalities
- Record daily steps and distance using Google Fit API
- Start a walking session that records your steps and distance separate from daily steps
- Save a walking session as a new route
- Create a new route without walking it first so the user can start recording a walk directly from this route later
- Form a walking team with other users so any user in the team can schedule and propose a walk to the team (implemented with Cloud Firestore storage with a few uses of JS Cloud functions)
- If the user is part of a walking team, the user can also see their teammate's personal routes to get ideas for exploring new routes

# Design Patterns in Practice
1. **Adapter**
 - This pattern is the most used. Every GoogleFit or Firebase api is masked through an Adapter which implements an interface
 - examples include `GoogleFitAdapter implements FitnessService` which adapts Google's Fit API and `FirebaseAuthAdapter implements AuthService` which adapts Google's FirebaseAuth. 
 
2. **Builder**
 - Many of our data models have multiple optional member variables. The `interface Builder` and interfaces that extend this interface help facilitate this. 
 - Examples include `RouteBuilder implements IRouteBuilder` and `RouteEnvironmentBuilder implements IRouteEnvironmentBuilder` 
 
3. **Observer**
 - Though not used as extensively, this helps solve a lot of the issues that occur with Google APIs' async network calls. By implementing `Subject` and observers, classes that adapt these kinds of methods can notify our application when calls are complete.
 - An example of this is `interface AuthService extends Subject<AuthServiceObserver>`
